# Introduction

This is my repo collecting my work from studying the MIT book, *Introduction to Algorithms 4th ed*. I plan on using this to supplement my current work in my CS degree and Automation projects for the EdTech company I currently work for. 

I will do my best to commit a little every week and work through book alongside the rest of my courseload.
